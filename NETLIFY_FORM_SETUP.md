## üöÄ Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Deploy Your Site to Netlify

1. **Push to GitHub** (already done!)
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Connect to Netlify:**
   - Go to [app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com)
   - Click "Add new site" ‚Üí "Import an existing project"
   - Choose GitHub
   - Select your `shackpck` repository
   - Configure build settings:
     - **Base directory:** `coins`
     - **Build command:** `npm run build`
     - **Publish directory:** `out`
   - Click "Deploy site"

3. **Wait for deployment** (usually 2-5 minutes)

### Step 2: Verify Form Detection

After your site deploys:

1. Go to your Netlify site dashboard
2. Click **"Forms"** in the left sidebar
3. You should see a form named **"contact"**
4. If you don't see it, wait a few minutes and refresh - Netlify needs to crawl your deployed site

**Note:** The form will only appear after your site is deployed and Netlify has detected the form HTML.

1. **In Netlify Dashboard:**

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Form not showing in Netlify?
- Make sure your site is deployed successfully
- Wait 5-10 minutes after deployment
- Check that the form has `name="contact"` and `netlify="true"` attributes
- The form MUST be in the deployed HTML (the hidden form handles this)

### Not receiving emails?
- Check your spam folder
- Verify email address in notification settings
- Test form submission again
- Check "Forms" section to see if submissions are being recorded

### Form submission fails?
- Check browser console for errors
- Make sure you're testing on the live Netlify URL (not localhost)
- Verify form name matches: `form-name: 'contact'`
