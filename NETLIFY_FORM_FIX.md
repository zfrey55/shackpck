# üîß Netlify Form Detection Fix

## ‚ùå Problem: Form Not Showing Up in Netlify

If you don't see the "contact" form in Netlify's Forms section, here's how to fix it:

---

## ‚úÖ Solution 1: Add netlify.toml Configuration

The most reliable way is to explicitly tell Netlify about the form in your `netlify.toml` file.

I see you already have a `netlify.toml` file in your root directory. Let me update it:

**Update your `netlify.toml` with:**

```toml
[build]
  base = "coins"
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "out"

# Force Netlify to detect the form
[[plugins]]
  package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"
```

---

## ‚úÖ Solution 2: Create a Static HTML Form Page

Netlify needs to crawl an actual HTML file to detect forms. Since you're using Next.js with static export, create a simple HTML form page:

**Create: `coins/public/contact-form.html`**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Contact Form</title>
</head>
<body style="display:none;">
  <form name="contact" netlify>
    <input type="text" name="name" />
    <input type="text" name="email" />
    <select name="subject">
      <option value="general">General Question</option>
      <option value="order">Order Inquiry</option>
      <option value="coin-info">Coin Information</option>
      <option value="shipping">Shipping Question</option>
      <option value="other">Other</option>
    </select>
    <textarea name="message"></textarea>
    <button type="submit">Send</button>
  </form>
</body>
</html>
```

This hidden page will be crawled by Netlify and the form will be detected.

## ‚úÖ Solution 3: Manual Form Registration

If the above doesn't work, you can manually register the form:

1. **Go to your Netlify dashboard**
2. **Click on "Forms" in the left sidebar**
3. **Scroll down and look for "Enable form detection"**
4. **Make sure it's enabled**
5. **Click "Save"**
6. **Trigger a new deploy:**
   - Go to "Deploys" tab
   - Click "Trigger deploy" ‚Üí "Clear cache and deploy site"

## üöÄ Complete Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Update netlify.toml

Add this to your `netlify.toml` file in the project root:

```toml
[build]
  base = "coins"
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "out"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "20"
```

### Step 2: Create the Static Form File

I'll create this for you - it will be in `coins/public/contact-form.html`

### Step 3: Redeploy

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Add Netlify form detection files"
git push origin main
```

### Step 4: Wait for Detection

After deploying:
1. Wait 5-10 minutes
2. Go to Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí Forms
3. The "contact" form should now appear

### Step 5: Set Up Email Notification

Once the form appears:
1. Click on the "contact" form
2. Go to "Form notifications"
3. Click "Add notification"
4. Choose "Email to verify"
5. Enter your email
6. Save

2. Make sure:
   - Base directory: `coins`
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `coins/out` (or just `out`)

### Check Form Detection is Enabled:

1. **Site settings ‚Üí Forms**
2. Make sure "Form detection" is enabled
3. Make sure "Spam filtering" is enabled

1. **Deploys tab**
2. Click "Trigger deploy"

4. Wait 10 minutes and check Forms section again

## üìß Alternative: Use Netlify Functions (Advanced)

If forms still don't work, you can use Netlify Functions:

1. I can help you set up a serverless function
2. The form will submit to the function
3. The function will email you directly
4. More reliable but slightly more complex

Let me know if you need this option!
