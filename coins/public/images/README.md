# Images Folder

This folder contains all static images for the Shackpack website.

## Subfolders:

- `/packs/` - Product images for trading card repacks
- `/hero/` - Hero banner images for homepage (optional)

## Adding Images:

1. Place images in the appropriate subfolder
2. Use descriptive filenames (lowercase, hyphens for spaces)
3. Optimize images before uploading (compress for web)
4. Reference images in code using: `/images/[subfolder]/[filename]`

## Example Usage in Code:

```tsx
<Image src="/images/packs/shackpack-starter.jpg" alt="Shackpack Starter" />
```
