## ❓ Question 2: Where do I upload checklists?

**Answer:** You have 3 options:

### Option 1: Google Sheets (EASIEST ⭐)
1. Create a Google Sheet with your coin list
2. Make it public (Anyone with link can view)
3. Send me the link
4. I'll add it to your website

**This is the BEST option** because:
- ✅ Easy to update anytime
- ✅ Searchable and sortable
- ✅ No file uploads needed
- ✅ Professional looking

### Option 2: PDF Files
**Location:** `coins/public/checklists/`

**Full Path:** `C:\Users\zfrey\OneDrive\Desktop\Shackpck\coins\public\checklists\`

**File Names:**
- `shackpack-starter.pdf`
- `shackpack-deluxe.pdf`
- `shackpack-xtreme.pdf`
- `shackpack-elite.pdf`

The website already links to these - just upload and they'll work!

### Option 3: I'll Build It Into The Page
Send me your coin lists and I'll create beautiful tables directly on the checklist page.

## ❓ Question 3: Change default pictures to coins?

**Answer:** ✅ DONE!

I've updated all the placeholder images to show **gold and silver coins** instead of trading cards.

The images now show:
- Gold coins (American Eagles, etc.)
- Silver coins (Maple Leafs, etc.) 
- Collectible coins
- Mixed metal coin collections

**Current images are from Unsplash** (free stock photos of real coins)

**When you upload YOUR pack photos**, they'll replace these placeholders automatically.

## ❓ Question 4: Checklist should show ALL coins that COULD be in each pack?

**Answer:** ✅ DONE!

The checklist page now shows:

### For Each Pack:
- Pack name and image
- Description: "Complete list of all coins that could be included in the [Pack Name]"
- **Two buttons:**
  1. **"View Coin List (Google Sheet)"** - Opens your Google Sheet
  2. **"Download PDF List"** - Downloads your PDF

### What the lists should include:
According to the page, the lists show:
- Coin names and denominations
- Year and mint mark
- Metal type (Gold, Silver, etc.)
- Weight and purity
- Condition/Grade information
- Rarity indicators
- Country of origin
- Special features or historical significance

### Important Note on Page:
> "These lists represent the complete pool of possible contents. Actual pack contents may vary based on availability, and we cannot guarantee specific coins in any individual pack."

This makes it clear that these are POSSIBLE contents, not guaranteed.
